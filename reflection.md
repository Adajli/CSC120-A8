- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
   My class is the Superhero class, which allows the superhero to perform the feats of flying, growing, walking, undoing, and srhinking. 
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
   I implemented accessor methods for the attributes of the superclass alongside those listed in the interface.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
  I at first had a hard time implementing undo, but then I got it worked out by myself and was able to manage coming up with ideas for implementing the other methods. I would advise someone to think through the answers before getting the solutions for someone taking this course in the future.
